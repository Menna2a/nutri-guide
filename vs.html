  <h2>HIIT vs Cardio Explained</h2>
HIIT is the acronym for high-intensity interval training. You might also know it as high-intensity intermittent exercise or sprint interval training.

HIIT is a type of cardiovascular exercise that alternates between intense anaerobic exercise and short recovery periods.

<h3>When it comes to training using HIIT, the standard method is:<br></h3>
<li><span>High-intensity exercise: completed for a duration of 30 seconds up to a maximum of three minutes.</span></li> 
Most common time frame is one to two minutes.
<li><span>Low-intensity exercise: complete for a duration of 30 secs up to the maximum time the high-intensity workout is performed.</span></li> 
If the max time for high-intensity is two minutes, then no more than two minutes for low-intensity.
<li><span>It is generally done for half the time of the high-intensity exercise.</span></li>

<h4>Cardio is short for cardiovascular exercise, also called steady-state cardio.
It’s a form of aerobic exercise that ranges from low to high intensity dependent on the type of exercise performed.</h4>
<h5>What’s the difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise?</h5>
<pre style="font-size: 15px;  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;" >
<ul>
<li>Aerobic exercise – defined by MedicineNet.com as “Brisk exercise that promotes the circulation of oxygen 
through the blood and is associated with an increased rate of breathing.
Examples include running, swimming, and bicycling.”</li>
<li>Anaerobic exercise – literally translates to “the absence of air” or “without oxygen.”
Anaerobic exercise “consists of brief intense bursts of physical activity,
such as weight lifting and sprints, where oxygen demand surpasses oxygen supply.
It is fueled by energy stored in your muscles through a process called glycolysis.”</li>
</ul>
