  <h2 class="Adults">Overview</h2>
  <p class ="p6" ><br>The adult life stage (ages 19 through 59) is characterized by independence, opportunity, and increased responsibility from starting or completing education
and training, to managing work and/or family, to planning for the transition to older adulthood. Balancing work or school responsibilities with personal, family,
or other commitments can create real
or perceived barriers to healthy eating. Constraints on available time and financial resources may make it challenging for adults to adopt and maintain a healthy dietary pattern. Support for healthy food and beverage choices across the multiple places where adults live, work, play,
and gather is needed to improve dietary patterns among adults.</p>

  <h3 class="Adults">The importance of physical activity</h3>
  <p class ="p6" ><br>Adults who are physically active are healthier, feel better, and are less likely to develop many chronic diseases than are adults who are inactive. For adults, regular physical activity can provide both immediate benefits (e.g., boost mood, reduce stress, improve sleep) and long-term benefits (e.g., improved bone health and reduced risk of many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease,
    type 2 diabetes, depression, dementia, and many types of cancer).
Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical activity is better than none. To attain the most health benefits from physical activity, adults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate- intensity aerobic activity, like brisk walking or fast dancing, each week. Adults also need muscle-strengthening activity, like lifting weights or doing push-ups, at least 2 days each week.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and related Move Your Way resources have more information about the benefits of physical activity and tips on how to get started. Available at <a class="Adults" href="https://health.gov/our-work/physical-activity/current-guidelines">health.gov/paguidelines</a>.</p>

<h3 class="Adults">Overweight & Obesity</h3>
<p class ="p6" ><br>In the United States, 74 percent of adults have overweight or obesity, creating an increased risk for the development of other chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.</br>

Losing weight and maintaining weight loss is not a simple task. It requires adults to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase the amount expended through physical activity. Weight loss and maintenance are not likely achieved using short-term solutions. They require a commitment to long-term lifestyle change and often need support from healthcare providers, family members, and social networks. Intensive behavioral interventions that use one or more strategies—like group sessions and changes in both diet and physical activity—can be effective for individuals trying to lose a significant amount of weight. In addressing obesity, professionals should be mindful of health problems stemming from obesity-related stigma and discrimination.</br>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website provides resources to support preventing weight gain <a class="Adults" href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/prevention/index.html">(cdc.gov/healthyweight/ prevention)</a>and losing weight <a class="Adults" href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/losing_weight/index.html">(cdc.gov/healthyweight/ losing_weight)</a>

  <h2 class="title4">Supporting Healthy Eating</h2> </pre>
  <p class ="p6" ><br>Individuals need support in making healthy choices at home, work, and in the community to build healthy dietary patterns.</p>
  <p class ="p6" ><br>Food retail outlets (e.g., grocery stores, convenience stores, restaurants) provide adults with the option to purchase ingredients to prepare foods themselves or to purchase foods prepared by others. National food expenditures suggest the purchase of prepared foods is a regular habit for most adults, with expenditures outpacing those of foods purchased for household meal preparation.3 Estimates also suggest that the younger generation of American adults are spending an even larger proportion of their total food dollars on prepared foods than are older generations.</p>
  <p class ="p6" ><br>When adults prepare meals themselves, they have more control over the types of food ingredients selected and can focus on choosing nutrient-dense options that contribute to food group goals with little or no added sugars and saturated fat and less sodium. The same
is not always true when purchasing prepared foods, despite changes and innovation in the marketplace, such as menu and product labeling or reformulation.</p>
<p class ="p6" ><br>For some adults, preparing and consuming healthy meals at home will mean adopting a new habit and/or learning new skills, such as meal planning. For others, it may entail small changes to current routines. Planning meals and snacks in advance with food groups and nutrient-dense foods and beverages in mind can support healthy eating at home and improve dietary patterns of individuals and families. Preparing meals with family and friends also presents an opportunity
for greater connection and enjoyment around food.
For adults who are parents, guardians, or caregivers of children or adolescents, preparing meals also provides an opportunity to teach valuable cooking skills and model behaviors that support the adoption of healthy dietary patterns across younger life stages.</p>
