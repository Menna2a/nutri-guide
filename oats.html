 <li><span>Oats may lower the risk of heart disease by reducing both total and LDL cholesterol and
 protecting LDL cholesterol from oxidation.</span></li>
 
 <li><span>Due to the soluble fiber beta-glucan, oats may improve insulin sensitivity and help lower blood sugar levels.</span></li>
 
 <li><span>Oatmeal may help you lose weight by making you feel more full. 
 It does this by slowing down the emptying of the stomach and increasing production of the satiety hormone PYY.</span></li>
 
 <li><span>Colloidal oatmeal (finely ground oats) has long been used to help treat dry and itchy skin. 
 It may help relieve symptoms of various skin conditions, including eczema.</span></li>
 
 <li><span>Some research suggests that oats may help prevent asthma in children when fed to young infants.</span></li>

    How to Incorporate Oats <br>
	Into Your Diet?
   </div>
   
  <div class="recipe">
<h2> The most popular way is to simply eat oatmeal for breakfast. </h2>

<h3> Here is a very simple way to make oatmeal:</h3>

<pre style="font-size: 20px;  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; ">
<ol>
<li> 1/2 cup of rolled oats </li>
<li> 1 cup (250 ml) of water or milk </li>
<li> A pinch of salt </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class= "instructions">
Combine ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook the oats, stirring occasionally, until soft. <br>
To make oatmeal tastier and even more nutritious, you can add cinnamon, fruits, nuts, seeds and/or Greek yogurt.<br>
Also, oats are often included in baked goods, muesli, granola and bread.
Although oats are naturally gluten-free, they are sometimes contaminated with gluten.<br>
Thatâ€™s because they may be harvested and processed using the same equipment as other grains that contain gluten.
If you have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, choose oat products that are certified as gluten-free.
